I downloaded following datasets:
-MPI-Sintel-complete (http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/downloads)
-Middlebury's other-color-twoframes (http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/data/)
-CUB_200_2011 (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html -> All Images and Annotations)

Then the Folderstructure is as following:

dlgmImplementation.ipynb
MPI-Sintel-complete <- subfolders as downloaded
Middlebury
  other-color-twoframes <- subfolders as downloaded
CUB_200_2011 <- subfolders as downloaded
SiftFeatures
